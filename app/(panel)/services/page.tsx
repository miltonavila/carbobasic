                Liquified gases are used in many applications. For bulk transportation purposes,
                gases are liquified and stored in tanks on ships, trucks or rail-trucks. Normally,
                on-shore storage in tanks is at atmospheric pressure or it can be pressurised in
                bullets or spheres. It is not well defined at what point on the temperature scale
                refrigeration ends and cryogenics begins, but scientists assume a gas to be

                Nuclear
              </p>
              <p className="text-sm">
                Large-scale nuclear is a very low-carbon technology, which provides a reliable
                baseload power at scale from a very small land area. As confirmed by the UNs
                International Atomic Energy Agency, nuclear power plants ‘are among the safest and
                most secure facilities in the world, and nuclear power is one of the safest forms of
                energy generation. Traditional nuclear power plants use heat produced during nuclear
                fission to produce steam. The steam is used to spin large turbines that generate
                electricity. Both the Committee on Climate Change and the International Energy
                Agency have highlighted the role for new nuclear electricity generating capacity, in
                partnership with renewables, as a key element of achieving net zero. A recent report
                by the UN Economic Commission for Europe was clear that “the worlds climate
                objectives will not be met if nuclear technologies are excluded” from future
                decarbonisation.

                Hydrogen
              </p>
              <p className="text-sm">
                Hydrogen and energy have a long shared history - powering the first internal
                combustion engines over 200 years ago to becoming an integral part of the modern
                refining industry. It is light, storable, energy-dense, and produces no direct
                emissions of pollutants or greenhouse gases. But for hydrogen to make a significant
                contribution to clean energy transitions, it needs to be adopted in sectors where it
                is almost completely absent, such as transport, buildings and power generation. The
                Future of Hydrogen provides an extensive and independent survey of hydrogen that
                lays out where things stand now; the ways in which hydrogen can help to achieve a
                clean, secure and affordable energy future; and how we can go about realising its
                potential.

              <p className="text-sm">
                EfW is an energy recovery process that generates renewable power in the form of
                electricity, heat or transport fuels from the controlled incineration of residual
                waste. An EfW plant contributes towards carbon emissions reductions and the reuse
                and recycling of materials that would otherwise go to landfill. The energy from
                waste or waste-toenergy industry is continuing to advance to provide more than just
                a renewable power source.
